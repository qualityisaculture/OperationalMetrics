## First Message Protocol

When a user sends their first message in a conversation, always ask follow-up questions to ensure complete understanding of the task before proceeding. This helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures the most accurate and helpful response.

### Required Follow-up Questions

1. **Clarify the scope**: Ask about the specific requirements, constraints, or boundaries of the task
2. **Confirm context**: Verify if this relates to existing code, a new feature, or a specific part of the codebase
3. **Understand priorities**: Ask about urgency, importance, or any specific preferences
4. **Check assumptions**: Confirm any assumptions about the user's environment, tools, or preferences

### Example Questions to Ask

- "Could you clarify the specific requirements for this task?"
- "Is this related to existing code in the project, or are we starting something new?"
- "What's the priority level and timeline for this?"
- "Are there any specific constraints or preferences I should be aware of?"
- "Should I focus on any particular aspect or approach?"

### When to Skip Follow-ups

- If the user explicitly states "no questions needed" or similar
- If the task is very simple and self-contained
- If the user is asking for a quick clarification or simple question

Always be polite and professional when asking follow-up questions, and explain why the clarification is helpful for providing the best possible assistance.
