# Guide: Refactoring Large React Components

This guide outlines a structured approach to refactoring large, monolithic React class components into smaller, more maintainable functional components using hooks. This process improves separation of concerns, testability, and overall code quality.

The refactoring is divided into two main phases: Logic Extraction and UI Decomposition.

## Phase 1: Logic Extraction and Scaffolding

The goal of this phase is to separate the business logic and data management from the UI rendering.

1.  **Analyze the Component**: Before making changes, thoroughly analyze the large component to identify its core responsibilities. Group functions and state variables based on their purpose (e.g., file handling, data processing, UI state).

2.  **Create New Directory Structure**:

    - Create a new directory named after the component (e.g., `src/client/MyComponent/`).
    - Inside this new directory, create the following subdirectories and files:
      - `hooks/`: For custom hooks that will contain the business logic.
      - `components/`: For the smaller UI components.
      - `types.ts`: For all TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
      - `constants.ts`: For any constants or static configuration data.
      - `index.tsx`: This will become the new, leaner main component.

3.  **Separate Constants and Types**:

    - Move all `interface` and `type` definitions from the original component file into `types.ts`.
    - Move any constant variables (e.g., configuration arrays, magic strings) into `constants.ts`.

4.  **Extract Logic into Custom Hooks**:
    - Create custom hooks within the `hooks/` directory to encapsulate related pieces of logic. For example, a component that fetches and processes data might have:
      - `useDataFetcher.ts`: A hook responsible for API calls and managing the raw data state.
      - `useDataProcessor.ts`: A hook that takes the raw data and performs filtering, sorting, and aggregation, managing the derived state.
    - Move the relevant state variables (`useState`) and handler functions from the original component into these hooks.
    - The hooks should return the state variables and handler functions needed by the UI.

## Phase 2: UI Decomposition and Integration

The goal of this phase is to break down the large `render` method into smaller, reusable presentational components.

1.  **Create UI Components**:

    - Identify logical sections of the UI within the original component's `render` method.
    - For each section, create a new functional component in the `components/` directory (e.g., `FileUpload.tsx`, `DataTable.tsx`, `FilterControls.tsx`).
    - These components should be "dumb" or "presentational," meaning they only receive data and callbacks via props and are not responsible for managing state.

2.  **Assemble the Main Component**:

    - In the new `index.tsx` file, create the main functional component.
    - Call the custom hooks created in Phase 1 to get access to the state and handler functions.
    - Compose the UI by rendering the smaller components created in the previous step, passing the necessary data and functions to them as props.

3.  **Finalize and Clean Up**:
    - Update any import paths throughout the application that were pointing to the old component file. They should now point to the new component directory (e.g., `import MyComponent from './MyComponent'`).
    - Once the new component is fully integrated and working correctly, delete the original large component file.

This structured approach ensures a smooth transition from a large, complex component to a more modular, maintainable, and modern architecture.
